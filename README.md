# Table-DB-Project
Final project for college - a command-line tool for editing and presenting table data for a specific dataset, written in Rust.

Install `rustc` and `cargo`, Rust's compiler and project management tool, and in the command line, enter `cargo run en` or `cargo run fr` from the root. The `en` and `fr` command-line options determine output language for province names.
